Repo for Omnifood site from Udemy HTML5/CSS3 course

## Overview

A simple HTML / CSS project to sharpen up the basic skills and to learn a couple new ones. 
This course introduced me to some basic animations using JavaScript waypoints and Animate.css.

### HTML - What I Learned

There wasn't too much new for me to learn as far as HTML goes. 
I did feel this course helped me be better about using more appropriate HTML tags for certain things. 
Such as using a `<section>` instead of just more `<div>`s, as well as `<header>` and `<footer>`. 
A small step towards having a better setup to accomodate screen-readers for accessibility.

### CSS - What I Learned

I was introduced to **Animate.css** which is great. A small utility animation library that's very easy to integrate.
It helped that before any animation I wanted I was coding from scratch which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of animations as a whole. 
It's also great that now I can use a library like this, understand what's happening when I read the code for the animations, and also be able 
to utilize some pretty awesome animations without having to actually take the time to code it all from scratch.

I learned much more about Web Design. Simple concepts of having balance of light and darker sections for good contrast. Keeping things relatively simple 
but still presenting well. The core needs of a basic company landing page. And my favorite, the Hero section. I've always loved a good Hero section and 
I was grateful to learn some tricks to give it a great look.

### JavaScript - What I Learned

The biggest thing I took from this course as far as JavaScript goes is the use of _waypoints_. A great feature to trigger animations as a user 
scrolls down the page. Animations don't have to be super flashy but timing them on a scroll has a great effect and I feel just gives the site 
a better look and feel.

#### Notes

- The PHP mailer function doesn't work. This was not developed using XAMPP or something similar so it was almost like just to get the contact form in 
the page and move on. The PHP code is in the codebase but is essentially unused and not fully configured to send an email to anyone.

This is the course I completed, [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 ](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/).
